# etch-A-sketch
Project where I build a browser version of a pseudo-sketchpad / Etch-A-Sketch (TOP)

### Pre-Project
- This will be my first 'challenging' project with limited resources to use as an aid other than myself and Google.
- I will be using and expanding upon my frontend development skills, with focus revolving around mainly CSS and JavaScript over HTML
- Goal is to build a webpage with a grid of square divs that users can color in by using their mouse whilst clicking and/or dragging across the grid.
- Users may have the option to color the grid using their choice of either black n' white, a certain RGB color, or auto-selecting rainbow.
- Other functions include a clear button, the option to increase or decrease the number of cells per row/column in the grid, i.e. increasing or decreasing resolution, eraser button, and perhaps some extra additions depending on how I feel when I'm done.
